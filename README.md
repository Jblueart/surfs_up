# surfs_up
Weather analysis with SQLAlchemy, Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code; Flask


## Using climate data to weigh risks in determining a new location for a surf shop 

Building an SQLite database: SQL Alchemy
advantages: Local to the computer for testing, no need for a server
scalable to different device types whether a website, or mobile app

disadvantages: fewer security featues than traditional SQL database

First Database holds: Date & Rate of precepitation per day


Out of 9 weather stations total measurements varied from 511 on the least, and 2772 for the max. 
That station USC00519281 had a Minimum temp of 54 degrees, Maximum temp of 85 degrees and Average temp of 71.66 degrees

Not a huge variation of temperatures from June to December


Would be smart to continue with temperature analysis of September & March to get a wider scope just to rule out extremes at other times of the year.
